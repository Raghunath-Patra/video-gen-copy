# 2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory

## Activity 2.1

*   Collect the following solutions from the science laboratory– hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄), nitric acid (HNO₃), acetic acid (CH₃COOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)₂], potassium hydroxide (KOH), magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)₂], and ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH).
*   Put a drop of each of the above solutions on a watch-glass one by one and test with a drop of the indicators shown in Table 2.1.
*   What change in colour did you observe with red litmus, blue litmus, phenolphthalein and methyl orange solutions for each of the solutions taken?
*   Tabulate your observations in Table 2.1.

*(Note: The table above is filled with expected results for Activity 2.1)*

**Expected Observations:**
*   Acids (HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃, CH₃COOH) turn blue litmus red, show no change with red litmus, remain colorless with phenolphthalein, and turn methyl orange red.
*   Bases (NaOH, Ca(OH)₂, KOH, Mg(OH)₂, NH₄OH) turn red litmus blue, show no change with blue litmus, turn phenolphthalein pink, and turn methyl orange yellow.

**Learnings/Conclusions:**
*   Different indicators show distinct color changes in acidic and basic solutions, allowing us to identify the nature of the substance.
*   Litmus (blue/red), phenolphthalein, and methyl orange are common indicators used to test for acids and bases.

These indicators tell us whether a substance is acidic or basic by change in colour. There are some substances whose odour changes in acidic or basic media. These are called olfactory indicators. Let us try out some of these indicators.

## Activity 2.2

*   Take some finely chopped onions in a plastic bag along with some strips of clean cloth. Tie up the bag tightly and leave overnight in the fridge. The cloth strips can now be used to test for acids and bases.
*   Take two of these cloth strips and check their odour.
*   Keep them on a clean surface and put a few drops of dilute HCl solution on one strip and a few drops of dilute NaOH solution on the other.
*   Rinse both cloth strips with water and again check their odour.
*   Note your observations.
*   Now take some dilute vanilla essence and clove oil and check their odour.
*   Take some dilute HCl solution in one test tube and dilute NaOH solution in another. Add a few drops of dilute vanilla essence to both test tubes and shake well. Check the odour once again and record changes in odour, if any.
*   Similarly, test the change in the odour of clove oil with dilute HCl and dilute NaOH solutions and record your observations.

**Expected Observations:**
*   The cloth strips will retain the characteristic smell of onions.
*   When HCl is added, the smell of onion is usually still detectable.
*   When NaOH (a base) is added, the smell of onion is typically destroyed or masked.
*   Vanilla essence retains its smell in acidic solution (HCl) but loses its smell in basic solution (NaOH).
*   Clove oil retains its smell in acidic solution (HCl) but loses its smell in basic solution (NaOH).

**Learnings/Conclusions:**
*   Onion, vanilla essence, and clove oil act as olfactory indicators.
*   Their characteristic smells are retained in acidic solutions but are diminished or destroyed in basic solutions.
*   This provides another way to distinguish between acids and bases, especially for visually impaired students.

Which of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory indicators on the basis of your observations?
*(Answer: All three - vanilla, onion, and clove can be used)*
