# 2.1.3 How do Metal Carbonates and Metal Hydrogencarbonates React with Acids?

## Activity 2.5

*   Take two test tubes, label them as A and B.
*   Take about 0.5 g of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) in test tube A and about 0.5 g of sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO₃) in test tube B.
*   Add about 2 mL of dilute HCl to both the test tubes.
*   What do you observe?
*   Pass the gas produced in each case through lime water (calcium hydroxide solution) as shown in Fig. 2.2 and record your observations.

**Expected Observations:**
*   Brisk effervescence (release of a gas) occurs in both test tubes A and B.
*   When the gas evolved is passed through lime water, the lime water turns milky/white precipitate is formed.

**Learnings/Conclusions:**
*   Acids react with metal carbonates and metal hydrogencarbonates to produce carbon dioxide gas (CO₂), salt, and water.
*   The effervescence is due to the evolution of CO₂ gas.
*   Carbon dioxide gas turns lime water (calcium hydroxide solution) milky due to the formation of insoluble calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).

The reactions occurring in the above Activity are written as –
Test tube A: Na₂CO₃(s) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l) + CO₂(g)
Test tube B: NaHCO₃(s) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l) + CO₂(g)
On passing the carbon dioxide gas evolved through lime water,
Ca(OH)₂(aq) + CO₂(g) → CaCO₃(s) + H₂O(l)
(Lime water) (White precipitate)

On passing excess carbon dioxide the following reaction takes place:
CaCO₃(s)+ H₂O(l)+ CO₂(g) → Ca(HCO₃)₂(aq)
(Soluble in water)
*(Observation if excess CO₂ is passed: The milkiness disappears as soluble calcium hydrogencarbonate is formed.)*

Limestone, chalk and marble are different forms of calcium carbonate. All metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates react with acids to give a corresponding salt, carbon dioxide and water.
Thus, the reaction can be summarised as –
Metal carbonate/Metal hydrogencarbonate + Acid → Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water
