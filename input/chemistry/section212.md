# 2.1.2 How do Acids and Bases React with Metals?

## Activity 2.3

*   CAUTION: This activity needs the teacher’s assistance.
*   Set the apparatus as shown in Fig. 2.1.
*   Take about 5 mL of dilute sulphuric acid in a test tube and add a few pieces of zinc granules to it.
*   What do you observe on the surface of zinc granules?
*   Pass the gas being evolved through the soap solution.
*   Why are bubbles formed in the soap solution?
*   Take a burning candle near a gas filled bubble.
*   What do you observe?
*   Repeat this Activity with some more acids like HCl, HNO₃ and CH₃COOH.
*   Are the observations in all the cases the same or different?

**Expected Observations:**
*   Bubbles of a gas are seen forming on the surface of zinc granules.
*   Gas bubbles are formed when the evolved gas passes through the soap solution.
*   When a burning candle is brought near a gas-filled bubble, the gas burns with a 'pop' sound.
*   Similar observations (gas evolution, pop sound test) are expected with HCl and CH₃COOH, though the reaction rate might vary (fastest with strong acids like HCl/H₂SO₄, slower with weak acid CH₃COOH). With dilute HNO₃, hydrogen gas is usually *not* evolved because HNO₃ is a strong oxidizing agent and oxidizes the H₂ produced to H₂O. (Exceptions: Very dilute HNO₃ with Mg or Mn).

**Learnings/Conclusions:**
*   Acids (like dilute H₂SO₄, HCl, CH₃COOH) react with active metals (like zinc) to produce hydrogen gas (H₂).
*   The presence of hydrogen gas is confirmed by the 'pop' sound test when a burning flame is brought near it.
*   The general reaction is: Acid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas.
*   Nitric acid generally does not produce hydrogen gas with metals due to its oxidizing nature, except under specific conditions (very dilute acid with Mg/Mn).

Note that the metal in the above reactions displaces hydrogen atoms from the acids as hydrogen gas and forms a compound called a salt. Thus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as –
Acid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas
Can you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed?
*(Examples: Zn(s) + H₂SO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + H₂(g); Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl₂(aq) + H₂(g))*

## Activity 2.4

*   Place a few pieces of granulated zinc metal in a test tube.
*   Add 2 mL of sodium hydroxide solution and warm the contents of the test tube.
*   Repeat the rest of the steps as in Activity 2.3 and record your observations.

**Expected Observations:**
*   Gas bubbles are evolved.
*   When tested with a burning candle near soap bubbles filled with the gas, a 'pop' sound is heard.

**Learnings/Conclusions:**
*   Some metals (like zinc, aluminum) react with strong bases (like NaOH) to produce hydrogen gas.
*   The other product is a salt (sodium zincate in this case).
*   Not all metals react with bases.

The reaction that takes place can be written as follows.
2NaOH(aq) + Zn(s) → Na₂ZnO₂(aq) + H₂(g)
 (Sodium zincate)
You find again that hydrogen is formed in the reaction. However, such reactions are not possible with all metals.
